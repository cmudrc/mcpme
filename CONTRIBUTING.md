# Contributing

## Development Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make dev
```

For a reproducible install based on `uv.lock`:

```bash
make lock
make repro
```

## Local Quality Checks

Run these before opening a pull request:

```bash
make fmt
make lint
make type
make docstrings-check
make test
make docs-check
make docs
```

Optional but useful:

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep changes small enough to review quickly.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Update docs and examples when interfaces change.
- Describe what changed and how you validated it.

## Code Style

- Python 3.12+ target
- Ruff for linting and formatting
- Mypy for type checking
- Pytest for tests
- Google-style docstrings in `src/`, `examples/`, and `scripts/`
